# 50_Startups
In this project, I have employed a machine learning algorithm to establish an algorithm that could predict the amount of profit companies could make depending on factors such as R&D Spend, Administrative Cost, and Marketing spend—applying the machine learning algorithm on a set of 50 startups, like Linear Regression, Ridge regression, Lasso Regression, Elastic net, KNeighborsRegressor, DecisionTreeRegressor and Random Forest Regressor. The data set was further split into training and testing viewers and the performance of each model was analysed based on regression measures like Coefficient of Determination (R²), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). It is seen that out of all models, Rigid Regression provided the highest accuracy regarding profit prediction.
